# habit-tracker

Quick demo habit tracker. Updates made:

- Improved auth and error handling
- Reworked UI with modern styling and accessibility tweaks
- Added service worker for offline caching
- Added PWA manifest and icons
- Added basic ESLint/Prettier configs and CI workflow

How to run locally: open `index.html` in a static server (e.g., `npx http-server`), then signup and use the dashboard.
